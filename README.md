## Ethereum account
> Firts create account on metamask (crome extension)
> When metamask created an account for us, it created an account that has three distinct pieces of information an account address, a public key and a private key. These are the three pieces of information that constitute an account on the ethereum network.
>- Account address : the account address can be thought of as essentially being like an email address.
>   - it's a unique identifier that can be shared with anyone in the world, and it tell other people who you are, identifies your account in some fashion.
>- Public and private key : These two pieces of information combined together to essentially form a password of sorts.
>   - The public key and the private key are used to authorize the sending of funds from your account  to other accounts.
>   - so if someone does not have the private key to an account, they don't have true access to any of the funds that are assigned to that account.
>
>#### *The account address, public and private key, are all stored as hexadecimal numbers*
